## The Problem: Server Not Running

Your Node.js application server is **NOT RUNNING**. That's why:
- ❌ You get HTTP 403 errors
- ❌ Cookies don't work
- ❌ Session persistence fails
- ❌ Everything redirects to login

## Why HTTP 403?

Port 5000 is occupied by **Apple's AirPlay Receiver** service (macOS):
```
Server: AirTunes/860.7.1
```

Your `.env` file correctly sets `PORT=5001` to avoid this conflict, but the server isn't running at all.

## Solution: Start the Server

### Step 1: Navigate to project directory
```bash
cd "/Users/ianring/Cursor/Car Crash Lawyer AI /Node.js"
```

### Step 2: Start the server
```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Server is running on port 5001
✅ Connected to Supabase
```

### Step 3: Use the CORRECT URL

**❌ WRONG:** `http://localhost:5000` (Apple AirPlay)
**✅ CORRECT:** `http://localhost:5001` (Your Node.js app)

## After Starting Server:

### Test cookies work:
```
http://localhost:5001/test-cookies-simple.html
```

### Test login:
```
http://localhost:5001/login.html
```

### Test home page:
```
http://localhost:5001/
```

## Quick Verification:

Test if server is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/healthz
```

Should return:
```json
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
```

## Why This Happened:

1. macOS reserves port 5000 for AirPlay Receiver
2. Your `.env` correctly uses port 5001
3. But the server wasn't started
4. Trying to access port 5000 hit AirPlay instead → 403 error
5. No Node.js server = No cookies = No session = Login loop

## Next Steps:

1. ✅ Start server: `npm start`
2. ✅ Use port 5001 in all URLs
3. ✅ Test cookies: `http://localhost:5001/test-cookies-simple.html`
4. ✅ Test login flow
5. ✅ Verify session persistence

---

**Summary:** Your code is probably fine. You just need to start the server and use the correct port (5001, not 5000)! 🎯
