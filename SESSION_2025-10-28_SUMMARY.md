# Session Summary: 2025-10-28

**Branch:** `feat/audit-prep`
**Status:** ✅ All Tasks Complete

---

## Session Objectives Completed

### 1. ✅ SQL Migration Verification
**User Request:** Verify signed_url migration was successful

**Approach:**
- Initially requested Playwright automation, pivoted to direct Supabase client (more secure)
- Created verification script using service role key
- Found 5 documents needing signed URLs
- Confirmed migration successful, columns exist and functional

### 2. ✅ Extended Signed URL Validity
**User Request:** Extend URL validity from 24 hours to match subscription period (12 months)

**Changes Made:**
- Updated 4 files to change expiry from 24h/1h to 365 days (31,536,000 seconds):
  1. `src/services/imageProcessorV2.js` (line 595): Upload-time generation
  2. `scripts/backfill-signed-urls.js` (line 48): Bulk backfill generation
  3. `lib/dataFetcher.js` (line 128): On-demand refresh for user_documents
  4. `lib/dataFetcher.js` (line 144): Legacy incident_images fallback

**Issue Encountered:**
- Backfill script only processes documents with `signed_url IS NULL`
- Existing 5 documents already had 24-hour URLs from previous run

**Solution:**
- Created inline Node.js script to manually refresh ALL documents
- Successfully updated all 5 documents
- All URLs now expire 2026-10-28 (12 months from today)

**Committed:** `c2976a1` - "feat: Extend signed URL validity to 12 months"

### 3. ✅ Dashboard Redesign Planning
**User Request:** Plan dashboard redesign moving away from Typeform, focus on modern UI/UX and branding

**Work Completed:**

#### Analysis Phase
- Analyzed current `dashboard.html` structure (2414 lines, 7 sections)
- Extracted existing branding colors (primary blue: #0B7AB0 family)
- Analyzed `signup-form.html` as new data entry point (9-page form)
- Identified current API endpoints and data flow
- Documented current strengths and weaknesses

#### Research Phase
- Used Task tool to research 2025 UI/UX trends for legal tech
- Gathered insights on:
  - Card-based layouts
  - Sidebar navigation patterns
  - Real-time status updates
  - Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.2 AA, EAA deadline June 2025)
  - Dark mode implementation
  - Mobile-first responsive design
  - UK market considerations

#### Planning Phase
- Created comprehensive `DASHBOARD_REDESIGN_PLAN.md` document covering:
  - Executive Summary
  - Current State Analysis
  - New Data Model (Typeform-independent via signup-form.html)
  - Redesign Goals & Principles
  - Proposed Structure (sidebar navigation)
  - Section-by-Section Redesign (7 sections detailed)
  - Technical Implementation Patterns:
    - CSP-compliant event delegation (remove inline `onclick`)
    - WebSocket real-time updates
    - Skeleton loaders (replace spinners)
    - Dark mode with CSS custom properties
    - 8px grid spacing system
    - WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility
  - 8-Week Implementation Roadmap
  - Success Metrics
  - Risk Mitigation
  - Phased Migration Strategy

## Key Technical Decisions

### Signed URL Architecture
**Decision:** Generate URLs at upload time with 12-month validity

**Rationale:**
- Matches subscription period (annual billing)
- Reduces on-demand generation overhead
- Dashboard and PDF generation use pre-generated URLs (faster)
- Automatic refresh in dataFetcher for expired URLs (safety net)

**All Generation Points Updated:**
```javascript
// Upload time (ImageProcessorV2)
const signedUrlExpirySeconds = 31536000; // 365 days

// Backfill script
const expirySeconds = 31536000; // 365 days

// On-demand refresh (DataFetcher)
.createSignedUrl(path, 31536000); // 365 days
```

### Dashboard Architecture Approach
**Decision:** Sidebar navigation with card-based sections

**Rationale:**
- Industry standard for legal tech dashboards
- Better information hierarchy
- Mobile adapts to bottom navigation
- Supports real-time status indicators
- Scalable for future sections

**Key Patterns:**
```javascript
// CSP-compliant event handling
document.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
  const target = e.target.closest('[data-action]');
  if (!target) return;

  switch(target.dataset.action) {
    case 'show-section':
      showSection(target.dataset.section);
      break;
  }
});

// WebSocket real-time updates
function handleRealtimeUpdate(update) {
  switch(update.type) {
    case 'image_processed':
      updateImageStatus(update.documentId, 'completed');
      showToast(`Image processed: ${update.documentType}`, 'success');
      break;
    case 'transcription_progress':
      updateTranscriptionProgress(update.transcriptionId, update.progress);
      break;
  }
  updateCounts();
}
```

---

## Current System State

### Signed URLs
- ✅ All generation points use 12-month expiry (31,536,000 seconds)
- ✅ All 5 existing documents refreshed with new expiry (2026-10-28)
- ✅ Code committed and pushed to `feat/audit-prep`

### Dashboard
- ⏳ Current dashboard.html unchanged (2414 lines, 7 sections)
- ⏳ Redesign plan documented in DASHBOARD_REDESIGN_PLAN.md
- ⏳ Awaiting user approval to begin Phase 1 implementation

### Database
- ✅ `user_documents` table has `signed_url` and `signed_url_expires_at` columns
- ✅ 5 documents with valid 12-month signed URLs
- ✅ Ready for PDF generation with long-lived URLs

---

## Next Steps (Pending User Approval)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
If user approves the redesign plan:

1. **Set up design system**
   - Create CSS custom properties for 8px spacing system
   - Implement dark mode variables
   - Add responsive breakpoint mixins

2. **Build sidebar navigation**
   - Create collapsible sidebar component
   - Add section icons and status indicators
   - Implement mobile bottom navigation

3. **Fix CSP violations**
   - Remove all inline `onclick` handlers
   - Implement event delegation pattern
   - Test across all sections

4. **Set up responsive grid**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px
   - Test on real devices

**Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks
**Risk Level:** Low (non-breaking changes)

## Technical Notes

### Why Manual Refresh Was Needed
The backfill script (`scripts/backfill-signed-urls.js`) only processes documents where `signed_url IS NULL`:

```javascript
// Backfill query (line 82)
.or('signed_url.is.null,signed_url_expires_at.is.null')
```

Since all 5 documents already had 24-hour URLs from a previous run, the backfill script correctly skipped them. A manual refresh script was needed to update the expiry time for existing URLs.

### DataFetcher Safety Net
Even if signed URLs expire, the dataFetcher has automatic refresh logic:

```javascript
// Check if signed URL exists and hasn't expired
if (doc.signed_url) {
  const expiresAt = doc.signed_url_expires_at ? new Date(doc.signed_url_expires_at) : null;
  const now = new Date();

  if (!expiresAt || expiresAt > now) {
    // URL is valid, use it directly (fast path)
    signedUrls[type] = doc.signed_url;
  } else {
    // URL expired, generate a fresh one (fallback)
    console.log(`⚠️  Signed URL expired for ${type}, generating fresh URL`);
    const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
      .from(bucket)
      .createSignedUrl(path, 31536000); // 365 days

    if (data && !error) {
      signedUrls[type] = data.signedUrl;
    }
  }
}
```

This ensures PDF generation never fails due to expired URLs.

## Quick Reference

### Useful Commands
```bash

require('dotenv').config();
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY);
supabase.from('user_documents').select('id, document_type, signed_url_expires_at').eq('status', 'completed').then(({data}) => console.log(data));
"

# Run backfill script (for new documents)
node scripts/backfill-signed-urls.js --dry-run

# Test PDF generation with current URLs
node test-form-filling.js [user-uuid]
```
