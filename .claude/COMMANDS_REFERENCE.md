```

**Learning the system:**
```
/architecture ‚Üí /db ‚Üí /docs
```

## Command Files Location

All commands are stored in:
```
.claude/commands/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ start.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ status.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ recent.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-all.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ help.md
```

You can edit any of these files to customize their behavior!

---

## How Commands Work

When you type `/start`, Claude Code:
1. Reads `.claude/commands/start.md`
2. Follows the instructions in that file
3. Returns the results to you

**The markdown file contains instructions for Claude, not for you!**

---

## Global Rules Integration

Commands work alongside `.claude/claude.md` global rules:

**Global Rules:** How I should code, communicate, and work
**Commands:** What specific tasks to do when you ask

Both work together to make sessions more efficient!

---

## Next Steps

1. **Try them out!** Start your next session with `/start`
2. **Customize them:** Edit command files to fit your workflow
3. **Create new ones:** Add commands for tasks you do frequently
4. **Share feedback:** Let me know which commands are most useful

**Questions about commands?** Just ask or run `/help`!
