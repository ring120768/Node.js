# Incident Report Form: Page Consolidation Strategy

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Purpose**: Document how 40+ Typeform screens are consolidated into 10 web form pages
**Status**: Planning Phase

---

## Overview

**Typeform Structure**: 40+ individual screens (one question per screen)
**Web Form Structure**: 9 multi-field pages (grouped by context)

**Benefits of Consolidation**:
- ‚úÖ **Faster completion** - Fewer page transitions (40 clicks ‚Üí 10 clicks)
- ‚úÖ **Better context** - Related fields visible together
- ‚úÖ **Mobile-friendly** - Immediate image upload (no ERR_UPLOAD_FILE_CHANGED)
- ‚úÖ **Progress visibility** - Clear visual progress (Page 2 of 10)
- ‚úÖ **Validation feedback** - Real-time field validation before proceeding

---

## Page-by-Page Breakdown

### Page 1: Legal Advisory
**Typeform Screens**: 1 screen
**Web Form Fields**: Legal advisory + acknowledgment checkbox only

**Purpose**: Critical legal guidance before starting the incident report

**User Experience**: Clean, focused page with advisory content only. No form fields to fill. User reads the legal guidance, acknowledges understanding, and continues. Feels calm and guided, not rushed or overwhelming.

---

#### Legal Advisory Statement (Informational - Must Read & Acknowledge)

**üö® CRITICAL: DO NOT ADMIT LIABILITY üö®**

**Visual Design**:
- Red/amber warning banner at top of page
- Large bold heading
- Clean, scannable bullet points
- "I Understand" checkbox required to proceed

**Advisory Content**:

> **DO NOT say any of the following:**
> - ‚ùå "I'm sorry, it was my fault"
> - ‚ùå "I wasn't paying attention"
> - ‚ùå "I didn't see you"
> - ‚ùå "My brakes failed"
> - ‚ùå Any statement accepting blame

> **What TO DO at the scene:**
> - ‚úÖ Exchange details only (name, registration, insurance)
> - ‚úÖ Take photos of all vehicles and scene
> - ‚úÖ Get witness contact details
> - ‚úÖ Note road/weather conditions
> - ‚úÖ Call police if anyone injured or vehicles blocking road

> **What TO SAY (if asked):**
> - ‚úÖ "I need to speak with my insurance company first"
> - ‚úÖ "I'm gathering all the facts before making any statements"
> - ‚úÖ "Let's exchange details and let insurance handle this"

> **Why this matters:**
> - üìã Anything you say CAN be used against you
> - üìã Fault determination is complex - let experts decide
> - üìã Admitting fault may void your insurance coverage
> - üìã You may not know all the facts at the scene

> **Remember:**
> Being polite ‚â† Admitting fault. You can be courteous while protecting your legal rights.

**Required Checkbox**:
‚òëÔ∏è "I understand that I must not admit liability at the scene or in this report. I will only state the facts."

**Button**: "I Understand ‚Äî Continue to Report" (disabled until checkbox checked)

**Navigation**: Proceeds to Page 2 (Safety Check & Basic Information)

     - üöë I'm injured and need medical attention
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è I'm in immediate danger

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Page Validation Strategy
Each page validates before allowing navigation to next page:

```javascript
function validatePage1() {
  const safe = document.getElementById('are_you_safe').value;
  const date = document.getElementById('accident_date').value;
  const time = document.getElementById('accident_time').value;

  if (!safe || !date || !time) {
    showError('Please complete all required fields');
    return false;
  }

  // If unsafe, redirect to emergency page
  if (safe === 'injured' || safe === 'danger') {
    window.location.href = '/emergency.html';
    return false;
  }

  return true;
}
```

### Immediate Image Upload (Mobile-Friendly)
```javascript
// Upload immediately when file selected
document.getElementById('scene_photo_1').addEventListener('change', async (e) => {
  const file = e.target.files[0];
  if (!file) return;

  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);
  formData.append('session_id', sessionId);

  const response = await fetch('/api/images/temp-upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
  });

  const { temp_path } = await response.json();

  // Store temp path for final submission
  tempUploads.scene_photo_1 = temp_path;

  // Show preview thumbnail
  showPreview('scene_photo_1', temp_path);
});
```

### Final Submission
```javascript
async function submitIncidentReport() {
  const formData = {
    // Page 1
    are_you_safe: document.getElementById('are_you_safe').value,
    accident_date: document.getElementById('accident_date').value,
    accident_time: document.getElementById('accident_time').value,

    // Page 2
    accident_location: document.getElementById('accident_location').value,
    incident_description: document.getElementById('incident_description').value,

    // ... all other fields ...

    // Images (temp paths from immediate uploads)
    temp_images: tempUploads
  };

  const response = await fetch('/api/incident-reports/submit', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(formData)
  });

  if (response.ok) {
    window.location.href = '/incident-submitted.html';
  }
}
```

## Database Mapping

All 131+ fields map directly to `incident_reports` table columns. The consolidation only changes the **presentation** (UI), not the **data structure** (database).

**No database changes required** - all existing webhook fields are preserved.

---

## Migration Approach

**Phase 1: Build Web Form** (parallel to existing Typeform)
- Create 9-page incident form in `/public/incident-form.html`
- Reuse signup form patterns (page navigation, validation)
- Test with real user data

**Phase 2: Add API Endpoint**
- Create `/api/incident-reports/submit` controller
- Validate incoming data
- Process temp images ‚Üí permanent storage
- Insert into `incident_reports` table
- Generate confirmation email

**Phase 3: Testing**
- Test all 9 pages with various scenarios
- Verify mobile image upload works
- Check validation on each page
- Confirm database inserts match Typeform structure

**Phase 4: Gradual Rollout**
- Keep Typeform as fallback
- Add toggle in dashboard: "New Incident Report (Beta)"
- Monitor for issues
- Collect user feedback

**Phase 5: Full Replacement**
- Make web form the default
- Remove Typeform integration (keep webhook for existing submissions)
- Update documentation

## User Experience Comparison

| Feature | Typeform (Current) | Web Form (Proposed) |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Total Screens | 40+ | 9 pages |
| Page Transitions | 40 clicks | 9 clicks |
| Mobile Upload | File handle expires | Immediate upload |
| Progress Tracking | % complete (vague) | Page 3 of 9 (clear) |
| Back Navigation | Limited | Full back/forward |
| Field Grouping | One per screen | Logical grouping |
| Validation Feedback | End of form | Real-time per page |
| Error Recovery | Start over | Fix page and continue |
| Accessibility | Limited keyboard nav | Full keyboard support |
| Pre-filled Data | URL parameters only | Session-aware pre-fill |
