## Technical Implementation Details

### Character Counting Pattern

Both pages use real-time character counting for textareas:

```javascript
textarea.addEventListener('input', () => {
  const length = textarea.value.length;
  charCounter.textContent = `${length} / ${MAX_LENGTH} characters`;

  if (length > MAX_LENGTH * 0.95) {
    charCounter.classList.add('error');
  } else if (length > MAX_LENGTH * 0.8) {
    charCounter.classList.add('warning');
  } else {
    charCounter.classList.remove('warning', 'error');
  }
});
```

### Conditional Section Display

Using `display: none` → `display: block` pattern:

```javascript
// Show/hide based on selection
if (value === 'yes') {
  container.classList.add('visible');
} else {
  container.classList.remove('visible');
  // Clear fields when hidden
  clearAllFields();
}
```

### Data Persistence

Both pages implement:
- **Auto-save:** On every input change
- **Load on init:** Restore from localStorage
- **Session management:** Shared temp_session_id

```javascript
function saveData() {
  const data = { /* collect all fields */ };
  localStorage.setItem('pageX_data', JSON.stringify(data));
  console.log('Page X data saved:', data);
}

function loadData() {
  const saved = localStorage.getItem('pageX_data');
  if (!saved) return;

  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(saved);
    // Restore all fields
    validateForm();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading data:', error);
  }
}
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Character counter not updating
**Symptom:** Counter stays at "0 / 1000 characters"
**Solution:** Check `textarea.addEventListener('input', ...)` is registered
**Verify:** Type in textarea and check console for errors

### Issue 2: Conditional sections not appearing
**Symptom:** Police details don't show when "Yes" selected
**Solution:** Verify radio option `data-value` matches conditional check
**Code:** `if (value === 'yes')` must match `data-value="yes"`

### Issue 3: Form validation not working
**Symptom:** Next button never enables
**Solution:** Check all required state variables initialized
**Verify:** `console.log()` each variable in `validateForm()`

### Issue 4: Data not persisting
**Symptom:** Page reload loses entered data
**Solution:** Check `localStorage.setItem()` is called on input
**Verify:** Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage → Check keys
