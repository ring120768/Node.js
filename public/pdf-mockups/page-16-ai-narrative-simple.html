          <textarea class="field-textarea" rows="30" style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.6; padding: 12pt;" placeholder="On the morning of Tuesday, 31st October 2025, at approximately 09:15 hours GMT, a road traffic collision occurred on the A40 Westway near the White City junction in West London. The incident involved two vehicles: a [User's Vehicle] driven by the claimant, Mr/Ms [Full Name], registration [REG], and a silver Ford Focus motor vehicle, registration AB12 CDE, driven by [Other Driver Name].

BACKGROUND AND JOURNEY COMMENCEMENT

According to the claimant's statement, the journey commenced at approximately 09:00 hours from the claimant's home address. The purpose of the journey was [Purpose]. The claimant reports that they were familiar with the route and had traveled it regularly.

Weather conditions at the commencement of the journey were described as overcast with light precipitation. The claimant specifically recalls that light rain began falling at approximately 09:14 hours. Road surface conditions were consequently wet but not waterlogged.

THE APPROACH TO THE COLLISION POINT

At approximately 09:12 hours, the claimant was traveling westbound on the A40 Westway dual carriageway. The claimant states that their vehicle was positioned in the nearside (left-hand) lane, traveling at approximately 40 miles per hour. This speed was consistent with the posted speed limit of 40 mph for that section of roadway.

Traffic density is described by the claimant as 'moderate' with steady flow. Visibility was categorized as 'good' despite the light rain, with an estimated visibility range of 100-200 metres. Road markings were reported as clearly visible.

As the claimant approached the White City junction at approximately 09:15 hours, they observed a silver Ford Focus motor vehicle in the offside (right-hand) lane, traveling in the same westbound direction at a similar speed.

THE COLLISION SEQUENCE

At approximately 09:15:45 hours, according to the claimant's audio recording, the silver Ford Focus began to maneuver from the offside lane toward the nearside lane occupied by the claimant's vehicle. The claimant specifically reports that no turn signal (indicator) was observed prior to this maneuver.

The claimant reports taking immediate evasive action by applying the vehicle's brakes. The claimant estimates that vehicle speed reduced from approximately 40 mph to approximately 25 mph in the seconds before impact. However, the lateral movement of the Ford Focus continued, resulting in contact between the vehicles.

The collision occurred at approximately 09:15:52 hours. The point of impact was to the rear-left quarter panel of the claimant's vehicle, as confirmed by photographic evidence. The claimant describes feeling a 'hard jolt' and hearing the sound of metal contact. The airbags in the claimant's vehicle did NOT deploy, and the claimant confirms that seat belts were in use at the time of impact.

IMMEDIATE POST-COLLISION ACTIONS

Following the collision, both vehicles came to a controlled stop on the hard shoulder of the A40 Westway, approximately 50 metres west of the collision point. The claimant and the other driver exited their respective vehicles at approximately 09:16 hours. The claimant reports that both parties were visibly shaken but neither reported injuries at the scene.

EXCHANGE OF DETAILS

Between approximately 09:16 and 09:20 hours, the claimant and the other driver exchanged mandatory information as required by the Road Traffic Act 1988. Details exchanged included full names, contact telephone numbers, vehicle registration numbers, insurance company details, and address information.

The claimant reports that the other driver was 'polite but nervous' and did not admit fault at the scene. Neither party contacted the police, as there were no injuries and both vehicles remained drivable.

EVIDENCE GATHERING AT SCENE

Between approximately 09:25 and 09:31 hours, the claimant captured photographic evidence using a mobile telephone device. A total of twelve (12) photographs were taken, depicting damage to both vehicles, overall scene including road layout, and vehicle registration plates.

No independent witness statements were obtained at the scene. The claimant reports that other vehicles passed by but did not stop.

SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS

At 14:30 hours on the same day, the claimant completed a comprehensive incident report form via the Car Crash Lawyer AI online portal. This report captured 98 data fields covering all aspects of the incident. The claimant also recorded an audio statement lasting 8 minutes 42 seconds, providing a verbal account of the incident while details were fresh in memory.
