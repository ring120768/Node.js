# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX: Add Missing Database Column

**Issue:** Incident reports not saving to Supabase (PGRST204 error)
**Root Cause:** Missing `special_conditions_animals` column
**Time to Fix:** 2 minutes
**Status:** 🔴 BLOCKING PRODUCTION LAUNCH

---

## What Happened?

Your server logs showed this error:
```
❌ Database insertion failed:
   Code: PGRST204
   Message: Could not find the 'special_conditions_animals' column of 'incident_reports' in the schema cache
```

**Translation:** The webhook code tries to save a field that doesn't exist in your database!

---

## The 2-Minute Fix

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run the Migration
1. Click **New Query** button
2. Open the file: `migrations/add-missing-special-conditions-columns.sql`
3. Copy the ENTIRE file contents
4. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

### Step 3: Verify Success
You should see this output in Supabase:
```
✅ ALTER TABLE
✅ COMMENT
✅ ALTER TABLE
✅ COMMENT
✅ SELECT (showing 5 special_conditions columns)
✅ SELECT (showing account_status column)
```

### Step 4: Test Form Submission
1. Go to your Typeform incident report: https://form.typeform.com/to/WvM2ejru
2. Fill out and submit a test incident report
3. Check your Replit logs for: `✅ Incident report inserted successfully`
4. Verify data appears in Supabase `incident_reports` table

---

## What Was Fixed?

**Added Columns:**
- ✅ `incident_reports.special_conditions_animals` (BOOLEAN) - The missing column causing the error
- ✅ `user_signup.account_status` (TEXT) - Optional field that was warning in logs

**Updated Documentation:**
- ✅ `TYPEFORM_SUPABASE_FIELD_MAPPING.md` - Added missing field to documentation
- ✅ `SUPABASE_DATA_NOT_SAVING_DEBUG.md` - Documented root cause and solution

---

## Why Did This Happen?

The `special_conditions_animals` field was:
- ✅ In your webhook controller code (`webhook.controller.js` line 889)
- ❌ **NOT** in your database schema
- ❌ **NOT** documented in field mapping

This discrepancy caused the PGRST204 error when trying to insert data.

  - New: `https://...replit.dev/api/webhook/typeform`
- [ ] Update Typeform webhook URL in dashboard
- [ ] Verify `TYPEFORM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is configured correctly

### Documentation
- [ ] Review updated `TYPEFORM_SUPABASE_FIELD_MAPPING.md`
- [ ] Bookmark `SUPABASE_DATA_NOT_SAVING_DEBUG.md` for troubleshooting

## Need Help?

### Check Server Logs
```bash
# On Replit, watch the console output
# Look for these messages:

🎯 TYPEFORM WEBHOOK [requestId]
✅ Signature verified successfully
📊 Incident data: 34 fields
💾 Inserting into Supabase incident_reports table...
✅ Incident report inserted successfully
   🆔 Database ID: 123
   📅 Created: 2025-10-26T...
```

### Verify Database Schema
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to confirm columns exist:
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'incident_reports'
  AND column_name LIKE 'special_conditions_%'
ORDER BY column_name;
```

### Still Having Issues?
1. Check `SUPABASE_DATA_NOT_SAVING_DEBUG.md` for comprehensive troubleshooting
2. Review server logs for specific error messages
3. Verify Supabase service role key is configured correctly
4. Test with `node scripts/test-typeform-webhook.js --type incident`
