# Mobile Keyboard Fix - Quick Summary

**Status:** âœ… Fix implemented and committed to `feat/audit-prep` branch

---

## What Was Fixed

**Problem:** Virtual keyboard on mobile devices (iOS/Android) was covering Typeform text input fields, making it impossible for users to see what they were typing.

**Impact:** Game-stopping UX issue - users couldn't complete incident report forms on mobile.

---

## Solution Applied

### Changes Made to `public/typeform-incident-report.html`

**1. CSS Changes:**
```css
/* BEFORE (Broken) */
html { overflow: hidden; }
body { overflow: hidden; position: absolute; }
#typeform-container { overflow: hidden; position: absolute; }

/* AFTER (Fixed) */
html { height: 100%; }
body { min-height: 100%; }
#typeform-container { min-height: 100vh; }
/* + iOS-specific -webkit-overflow-scrolling optimizations */
```

**2. JavaScript Changes:**
```javascript
/* BEFORE (Broken) */
disableScroll: true,
height: window.innerHeight || 900,

/* AFTER (Fixed) */
disableScroll: false,
height: '100vh',
```

**3. Viewport Meta Tag:**
```html
<!-- Enhanced with interactive-widget support -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, interactive-widget=resizes-content">
```

## Why This Works

**Root Cause:** Your original code had three layers of `overflow: hidden` plus absolute positioning, which completely disabled scrolling. Mobile browsers rely on scroll to automatically pan the page when the keyboard appears.

**Solution:** Enable native scrolling and remove fixed positioning. This allows the browser to use its built-in, battle-tested keyboard handling to automatically scroll input fields into view.

**Advantages:**
- âœ… Most reliable (uses browser's native behavior)
- âœ… Works on all mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- âœ… Zero JavaScript overhead
- âœ… Future-proof
- âœ… Maintains desktop experience

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Mobile Test

**Option 1: Use Test Page**
1. Open on mobile: `https://your-domain.com/test-mobile-keyboard.html`
2. Tap each input field
3. Verify keyboard doesn't cover inputs
4. Check verification checklist on page

**Option 2: Test Real Typeform**
1. Open on mobile: `https://your-domain.com/typeform-incident-report.html`
2. Complete form as normal user would
3. Verify inputs scroll into view when focused
4. Confirm you can see text as you type

### Devices to Test

**Critical (must test):**
- âœ… iPhone (iOS 15+) with Safari
- âœ… Android phone with Chrome

**Nice to have:**
- iPad Safari
- Android tablet Chrome
- Samsung Internet browser

### What to Verify

1. **Tap input field** â†’ Keyboard appears
2. **Input scrolls into view** â†’ Visible above keyboard
3. **Type text** â†’ Can see what you're typing
4. **Navigate to next field** â†’ Scrolls correctly
5. **Dismiss keyboard** â†’ No weird jumps
6. **Re-focus input** â†’ Works correctly

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Production)

1. **Mobile Testing** (Priority 1)
   - Test on real iOS device (iPhone with Safari)
   - Test on real Android device (Chrome)
   - Verify using test page: `test-mobile-keyboard.html`
   - Complete full Typeform flow on mobile

2. **Desktop Regression Testing** (Priority 2)
   - Verify Typeform still displays correctly on desktop
   - Check no unwanted scrollbars appeared
   - Confirm gradient background still full-screen

3. **Cross-Browser Testing** (Priority 3)
   - iOS Safari (most critical)
   - Android Chrome (most critical)
   - Firefox Mobile
   - Samsung Internet (if UK users use it)

### If Issues Arise

**Rollback Plan:**
```bash
git revert 6ece94d
git push origin feat/audit-prep
```

Or manually revert by restoring old CSS/JS (documented in `MOBILE_KEYBOARD_FIX.md`)

## Expected Outcome

**After this fix:**
âœ… Users can complete Typeform incident reports on mobile devices
âœ… Virtual keyboard no longer covers input fields
âœ… Inputs automatically scroll into view when focused
âœ… Smooth, natural typing experience on mobile
âœ… Desktop experience unchanged

**User feedback to monitor:**
- Mobile form completion rates (should increase)
- Support tickets about "can't see what I'm typing" (should decrease to zero)
- Mobile bounce rates on Typeform pages (should decrease)

## Support & Troubleshooting

**If inputs still covered on some devices:**
1. Check viewport meta tag is correctly set
2. Verify `disableScroll: false` in widget config
3. Test on device's native browser (not third-party)
4. See troubleshooting section in `MOBILE_KEYBOARD_FIX.md`

**If desktop experience broken:**
1. Check for unwanted scrollbars (should be none)
2. Verify form fills viewport (should be full-screen)
3. Confirm gradient background visible (should cover screen)
