## Outstanding Tasks

### 1. what3words Map Widget (Mobile Issue)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT YET STARTED**

**User Report:** "What3words map not showing in mobile"

**Current Implementation:**
- Page 4 line 373: Simple text input for what3words address
- No interactive map widget

**Required:**
- Integrate what3words JavaScript API
- Add interactive map component for mobile users
- Auto-fill text input when user selects location on map
- Ensure mobile-responsive design

**Reference:**
- what3words Developer Documentation: https://developer.what3words.com/tutorial/javascript
- API key already in environment: `WHAT3WORDS_API_KEY`

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Improves UX but not blocking form submission

---

### 2. Mobile UI Positioning Issues

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRES TESTING ON ACTUAL DEVICE**

**User Report:** "screen positioning being inconsistent and detached from the UI"

**Potential Causes:**
1. Sticky banner positioning (`position: sticky`)
2. Safe area insets for iOS notch
3. Form section spacing inconsistencies
4. Navigation button padding

**Required Actions:**
1. Test on actual mobile device (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
2. Check console for CSS errors
3. Verify viewport meta tag working correctly
4. Test sticky positioning behavior during scroll
5. Check safe area insets on iPhone with notch/Dynamic Island
6. Verify form inputs don't cause zoom on iOS (font-size: 16px rule)

**Debugging Steps:**
```bash
# Connect mobile device to same network as Replit
# Visit: https://[your-replit-url]
# Use browser dev tools (remote debugging):
#   iOS: Safari ‚Üí Develop ‚Üí [Device Name]
#   Android: Chrome ‚Üí DevTools ‚Üí Remote Devices
```

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours (depends on specific issues found)

**Priority:** MEDIUM - May affect some users but form is functional

---

### 3. Page 2 Safety Check (NO CHANGES NEEDED)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED - Keep as is**

**User Clarification:** "Safety check (important for safeguarding"

**Current Content:**
- Section: "Is everyone safe right now?" (üõ°Ô∏è)
- Options: Yes / No / Emergency services needed

**Action:** NO CHANGES REQUIRED - Safety check is a safeguarding requirement and stays as implemented
