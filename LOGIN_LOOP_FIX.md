# Login Loop Fix - Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Branch:** feat/audit-prep
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem Report

User reported "login is looping" with dashboard unexpectedly involved in the login flow.

### User's Explicit Requirements:
> "Dashboard should be dormant as it has been problematic in the build and definitely not be involved in login. Dashboard is only for the user to edit and delete their data."

### Observed Behavior:
From server logs, the sequence was:
```
1. POST /api/auth/login → ✅ Login successful
2. Cookies set: access_token, refresh_token
3. Redirect to /dashboard.html
4. GET /dashboard.html → ⚠️ Page access denied - No session token
5. Redirect to /login-improved.html?redirect=%2Fdashboard.html
6. [LOOP: Steps 1-5 repeat]
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Cookie Name Mismatch (PRIMARY CAUSE)

**Problem:**
- Login controller sets cookies: `access_token`, `refresh_token`
- PageAuth middleware looks for: `sb-access-token`, `sb-auth-token`
- Middleware couldn't find the session token → denied access

**Evidence:**
- `src/controllers/auth.controller.js` lines 173, 180, 254, 262:
  ```javascript
  res.cookie('access_token', authResult.session.access_token, {...});
  res.cookie('refresh_token', authResult.session.refresh_token, {...});
  ```

- `src/middleware/pageAuth.js` line 49 (BEFORE FIX):
  ```javascript
  const sessionToken = cookies['sb-access-token'] || cookies['sb-auth-token'];
  ```

**Why this happened:**
- Auth controller uses custom cookie names (`access_token`)
- Middleware expected Supabase naming convention (`sb-access-token`)
- This inconsistency caused middleware to always fail authentication

### Issue 2: Dashboard as Default Redirect (SECONDARY CAUSE)

**Problem:**
- `public/login-improved.html` defaulted to `/dashboard.html` after login
- User explicitly did not want dashboard in login flow

**Evidence:**
- Line 351 (BEFORE FIX):
  ```javascript
  if (!redirect) {
    return '/dashboard.html'; // Default to dashboard after login
  }
  ```

- Line 364 (BEFORE FIX):
  ```javascript
  console.warn('Invalid redirect URL, defaulting to dashboard');
  return '/dashboard.html';
  ```

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Match Cookie Names in PageAuth Middleware

**File:** `src/middleware/pageAuth.js`

**Changes (Line 49):**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
const sessionToken = cookies['sb-access-token'] || cookies['sb-auth-token'];

// AFTER:
const sessionToken = cookies['access_token'] || cookies['sb-access-token'] || cookies['sb-auth-token'];
```

**Changes (Line 111 - apiAuth function):**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
sessionToken = cookies['sb-access-token'] || cookies['sb-auth-token'];

// AFTER:
sessionToken = cookies['access_token'] || cookies['sb-access-token'] || cookies['sb-auth-token'];
```

**Why this works:**
- Now checks for `access_token` FIRST (the actual cookie name used)
- Falls back to Supabase conventions for backward compatibility
- Middleware can now find the session token after login

**Commit:** `fix: Match cookie names in pageAuth middleware (access_token not sb-access-token)`

### Fix 2: Remove Dashboard from Login Flow

**File:** `public/login-improved.html`

**Changes (Lines 350-351, 363-364):**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
if (!redirect) {
  return '/dashboard.html'; // Default to dashboard after login
}
...
console.warn('Invalid redirect URL, defaulting to dashboard');
return '/dashboard.html';

// AFTER:
if (!redirect) {
  return '/'; // Default to home page after login
}
...
console.warn('Invalid redirect URL, defaulting to home page');
return '/';
```

**Why this works:**
- Home page (`/`) is the proper entry point for authenticated users
- Home page has navigation buttons for incident reports, dashboard, etc.
- Dashboard only accessible via direct navigation (as user requested)
- Aligns with user requirement: "Dashboard should be dormant and not be involved in login"

**Commit:** `fix: Remove dashboard from login flow, redirect to home page instead`

## Testing & Verification

### Server Status: ✅ Running Successfully

```bash
✅ Auth service initialized (ANON + SERVICE ROLE keys)
✅ Supabase connected
✅ OpenAI connected
✅ Server listening on 0.0.0.0:3000
✅ Health check passed: 200
```

### Expected Behavior After Fix:

**Scenario 1: Login with no redirect parameter**
```
1. User visits /login-improved.html
2. Enters credentials
3. POST /api/auth/login → Success
4. Cookies set: access_token, refresh_token
5. Redirect to / (home page)
6. Home page loads → pageAuth finds access_token → Authenticated ✅
```

**Scenario 2: Login with redirect parameter (e.g., incident form)**
```
1. User clicks "Report Incident" (not authenticated)
2. pageAuth middleware detects no session
3. Redirects to /login-improved.html?redirect=/incident-form-page1.html
4. User logs in
5. Redirect to /incident-form-page1.html
6. Page loads → pageAuth finds access_token → Authenticated ✅
```

**Scenario 3: Direct dashboard access**
```
1. User manually navigates to /dashboard.html
2. pageAuth verifies session (finds access_token)
3. Dashboard loads (for data management only) ✅
```

### What Changed:
- ✅ Cookie lookup now matches actual cookie names
- ✅ No more "Page access denied - No session token" after successful login
- ✅ Dashboard removed from automatic login flow
- ✅ Home page is now default post-login destination
- ✅ Dashboard only accessible via direct navigation

## Architecture Pattern: Server-Side Page Authentication

**This implementation follows the "security wall" pattern:**

1. **Server-side middleware** checks auth BEFORE serving HTML
2. **HTTP-only cookies** prevent JavaScript access (more secure)
3. **Automatic redirects** via HTTP 302 (seamless UX)
4. **No client-side auth checks** needed (simpler code)

**Benefits:**
- More secure (server validates before serving sensitive pages)
- Simpler frontend (no auth logic in JavaScript)
- Better UX (transparent redirects)
- Mobile-friendly (no visible "checking auth" delays)

**Key Files:**
- `src/middleware/pageAuth.js` - Server-side authentication middleware
- `src/app.js` - Protected routes using pageAuth
- `public/login-improved.html` - Login form with redirect handling

- [x] Changes committed to feat/audit-prep
- [x] Changes pushed to remote
- [x] Server running successfully
- [ ] End-to-end testing with real credentials
- [ ] Verify no login loop with test accounts
- [ ] Monitor logs for any auth-related warnings

## Next Steps

1. **Test login flow end-to-end** with actual user credentials
2. **Verify** no more "Page access denied" after successful login
3. **Confirm** home page loads correctly after login
4. **Monitor** server logs for any authentication issues
5. **Consider** adding automated tests for auth flow
